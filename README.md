# Fast Oriented Text Spotting(FOTS)
Incidental scene text spotting is considered one of the most difficult and valuable challenges in the document analysis community.In daily life text is present in variety of natural scenes such as road signs, shop names, posters, signboards etc. Sometime these text present in images even help one to understand context of Image.Reading text in natural images has attracted increasing attention in the computer vision community .

This problem is combination of Computer Vision and NLP it has numerous practical applications in document analysis, scene understanding, robot navigation, image retrieval ,self driving cars,etc . It's also one of the most challenging tasks because of the of the different fonts, sizes/scales and alignment of the text in real life images.

In this work we are going to implement the research paper FOTS which focus on detection and recognition of text at the same time from the real world images.
